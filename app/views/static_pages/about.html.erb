  <h1>Behind Heed the Herd</h1>
  <p>This site began as a simple way to make sure that Nicole Radford's horses were taken care of while she was living in Utah and had to leave her horses behind in Virginia. Along the way the site grew to encompass more and more features as each member of the team brought new ideas to the table.
